# 👋 Hello Traveler! Welcome to Tie's Econ Support Station

> *Located in Ottawa, maintained by a PhD student at Carleton University.*

This is the archive where I store my teaching assistant notes and survival guides.

I know economics can be intimidating. Maybe you are afraid of the math, or the models feel **abstract**. I built this repository during my PhD journey to help you bridge that gap.

**Whether you are aiming for an A+, or just trying to survive the calculus, there is something here for you.**

## 🤝 My Promise
* **Plain English First:** No jargon without explanation.
* **Visualized Math:** I use graphs to show you what the equations actually *look* like.
* **The "Why":** I will show you why we learn this. (To think like Spock: *Live Long and Prosper* 🖖).

## 📂 How to use this repo
* **Zone 1:** `Math Survival Kit` (For when you forgot how to take a derivative).
* **Zone 2:** `Micro Theory` (Consumer & Producer Theory).
* **Zone 3:** `Advanced Corner` (For the brave souls preparing for grad school).
(more are on the way).

*Use these notes freely. If you find a mistake or have a suggestion, please open an Issue or tell me directly — we are learning this together.*
